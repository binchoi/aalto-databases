--q1. Find the average price of food products (rounded up to two decimals).

SELECT ROUND(AVG(price),2)
  FROM Product
 WHERE Product.type = "food";

--q2. Find the total amount of products in each product type. The query should output the product type and the amount of products in it.

SELECT Product.type,
       COUNT( * ) 
  FROM Product
 GROUP BY Product.type;

--q3. For each order, find the amount of different kinds of food products in it. The query should output the order ID and the 
--    amount of different kinds of food products.

--q4. Find the total price for each order. Note that same item can be included several times in single order (the attribute amount). 
--    The query should output the order ID and the total price of the order (rounded up to two decimals).

--q5. Find the customers who have spent in total at least 40 â‚¬ in the shop. "In total" means that the total spend can include many 
--    separate orders. The query should output the name of customer, the amount of orders he/she has made, and the total sum of the orders (rounded up to two decimals).

SELECT * FROM Product;
SELECT * FROM Customer;
